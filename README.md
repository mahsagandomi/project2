Project Description

This project is a Java-based application that demonstrates the creation and management of customers and their associated bank accounts using Java Persistence API (JPA) for database interaction. The application focuses on handling customer data, managing multiple types of bank accounts, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these entities.

The main components of the project are:

    Entities:
        Customer: Represents a customer with details like ID, name, address, phone number, and birthdate.
        Account: Represents a bank account with attributes such as account number, balance, and account type (e.g., Checking, Saving, Business).
        The relationship between Customer and Account is one-to-many, meaning each customer can have multiple accounts.

    Database Interaction:
        The project uses JPA to interact with a relational database. The EntityManager and EntityManagerFactory are used to perform operations like saving, updating, and deleting entities from the database.
        The PersistenceUnit is defined to specify the database connection and properties for JPA.

    Transaction Management:
        The operations on customers and accounts are wrapped within a transaction to ensure that the entire process is atomic. If an error occurs, the transaction is rolled back to maintain data integrity.

    Exception Handling:
        The project includes custom exceptions like BirthdateException and AccountTypeException to handle specific validation issues. For example, invalid birthdates or account types are caught and logged.
        General exceptions are also handled to capture any unexpected errors during the process.

    Logging:
        Log4j is used to log various events and errors during the execution. For instance, when customers and accounts are created or if an error occurs (e.g., invalid birthdate or account type), appropriate log messages are recorded for debugging and monitoring purposes.

    Customer and Account Creation:
        The main logic of the application involves creating 10 customer records, each associated with one or more bank accounts. These customers and accounts are then persisted to the database.
        The data includes a mix of account types (e.g., Checking, Saving, Business) for each customer.

    Commit and Rollback:
        After the customers and their accounts are successfully created, the transaction is committed, making the changes permanent in the database. If any exception occurs during the process, the transaction is rolled back to ensure no partial changes are saved.

    Closing Resources:
        After the operations are complete, the EntityManager and EntityManagerFactory are closed to release database resources, ensuring proper cleanup.

Key Features:

    Customer Management: Creating and managing customer data.
    Bank Account Management: Managing different types of bank accounts (e.g., Checking, Saving, Business).
    JPA Integration: Using Java Persistence API to interact with the database.
    Error Handling: Handling specific and general exceptions, ensuring robust error management.
    Logging: Using Log4j to track the applicationâ€™s behavior and errors.

This project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of working with JPA, entity relationships, and handling transactions within a database application. It is an essential example of how to build a simple yet scalable database-driven application using Java.
